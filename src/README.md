# Basic Weather app

I forked the https://github.com/VolosR/TTGOWeatherStation project and made it work with PlatformIO, as well as using a cloned version of the TFT_eSPI library from the https://github.com/christhomas/tft-espi-lilygo-esp32-s3-tdisplay library which was necessary to get the screen working correctly.

I tidied up the code to make it more readable and here you have a screenshot of the software running.
